# SEOheroes
SEOheroes is a project to show that I have sufficient knowledge of html accessibility and what that means for people with limited web accessibility using tools such as screen readers and other assistive technologies.
Why this is important is that the internet should be able to be accessed by everyone no matter what disadvantages some people might have.
More recently in the web development world this has become a necessity for the web, after all not having an accessible website might make you liable to litigation.

## What SEOheroes features help disadvantaged web users? 
Web users that are hard of sight might be using a web assistive technology called a screen reader this helps the user access the main content of the website by verbally describing the content. 
Below is a better description of what web assitive technologies there are available to the modern day disadvantaged web user.
"Screen Readers, Text-to-Speech, and Braille Computers.
Color Blindness Settings.
Hearing Devices, Auto-Captioning, and Speech-to-Text.
Adaptive Mouses, Keyboards, and Alternative Input Methods."
